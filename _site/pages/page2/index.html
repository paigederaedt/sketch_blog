	  <p class="post-content"><p>Zach started off this morning with a class on text processing which I was SUPER excited about. He did a little website scraping with Beautiful Soup which was a nice refresher since I usually use regex. He also showed us some ways to analyze text like the Levenshtein distance which measures the ‘distance’ between words. I think I want to use this in my particle system sketch to control forces between words - maybe words that are ‘closer’ to each other could have a greater attraction to each other?</p>

<p>We finished the day with Ida’s first recess field trip. We started off by checking out the remains of some abandoned subway stops that were build using the neumatic system. You can see them if you look out the window on the 6 line.  </p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/neumaticsubway.JPG" alt="neumatic subway" />  </p>

<p>Next we made our way to the New York public library to find out that it was unfortunately closed because of Veteran’s day. They have some remains from the neumatic mail system that used to be used in Manhattan. We finished the trip by taking an air tram to Roosevelt Island. Wonder why? They apparently use a neumatic system for their trash. Overall a super fun day with great weather!</p>

	  <p class="post-content"><p>Taeyoon had a drawing + circuits class today which was super fun. At first his classes are always really overwhelming because I usually have no idea what the heck is going on. Once I spent some time with it and asked Taeyoon a few questions, I was feeling a lot better. I think it really helped to make drawing a part of the class because it really forced you to consider whether or not you fully understood the concepts - or at least enough to draw them out in a way that makes sense. Today’s lesson was focused on memory. We created a circuit with 2 switches - one switched and LED on and off as expected, and when a second switch was activated, it held the condition of the LED. So satisfying, even if it was a super basic memory model.</p>

	  <p class="post-content"><p>Today was partly studio again - it was nice to continue working on my particle system of words. Thanks to some help from Toru, I got the colors working how I want them to!</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/wordparticles.png" alt="word particles" /></p>

<p>After lunch we had an artist talk with <a href="http://christinesunkim.com/">Christine Sun Kim</a>. She is most well known for being a deaf sound artist, which is pretty cool. Although her work was amazing, the experience of her talk with the translator was equally fascinating. The way her translator acted as her audible outlet was exactly as I would have pictured Christine talking aloud, in terms of the expression and way she delivered her words. I also just love the energy of sign language - Christine explained a lot about deaf culture and sign language through her pieces which was great. Something that was also equally refreshing: Christine was the first artist to reveal some work in progress ideas and very sincerely ask us for feedback in a non superficial way. It was nice that we were able to give her suggestions that she was actually writing down and taking into account.</p>

	<h3> 
	  <p class="post-content"><p>Today Zach went over some more particle systems stuff. Most of it included working with vector fields. I’m still having trouble figuring out how he’s implemented them, but I need to look into it more. They can be used to deal with interaction really nicely, and it really makes me want to incorporate using my webcam to manipulate my word particle system somehow.</p>

<p>I spent the rest of today working on my word particle system. I think it’s coming along nicely. I’ve figured out how to get live typing to work, but I’m having trouble integrating any language processing I’m doing in python with my open frameworks sketch. Hopefully I can get something working soon.</p>

<p>Later today we had a mixer at the New Museum with <a href="http://newinc.org/">New Inc</a>. They’re kind of like an artist, hacker, and startup community combined, which I think is a nice idea. No one is forced to work together and I don’t know that participation is project based, but the idea is to just have all these different groups of people accessible to each other and see what happens. Everyone there was super nice and interesting, and we even got to hear a few of them speak along with other SFPC students. </p>

<p>After that, a few of us went to grab some dinner at Cafe Habana. They have some pretty great burritos, but are apparently known for their corn which I didn’t know until after I ordered…oh well, for another time!</p>

This week the theme was Sci-Fi and Utopias which was pretty fun…or not, depending on how you think about it. I really enjoyed the readings, but had a lot of anxiety about presenting. Overall, I think it went okay…just glad we got it over with.

<p>Next was Taeyoon’s class where we learned how to use a speaker to emit a square wave that we somehow created through a circuit…still wrapping my head around what happened, but it was pretty fun! We also got a chance to see the waves we had created in an oscilloscope.</p>

<p>After this we had a workshop with one of the creators of <a href="http://docs.spacebrew.cc/">Spacebrew</a>. He showed us how he used Kyle McDonald’s face recognition software to turn a light on and off by winking into your webcam. And that’s just the beginning of what you can do with Spacebrew. We spent some time getting comfortable with the interface and integrating with Processing. He also showed us how to set up our own node.js server to keep any applications we make running on the web for interaction. It was super fun and I’ve had so many thoughts about what you could do with it so far!</p>

He showed us a bunch of examples using trigonometry to create cyclic animation patterns that really bring objects to life. He asked us to create an animation inspired by John Whitney and also make a creature that we animate with certain characteristics as homework.</p>

<p>After this was Ramsey’s class. We spent some time going over some examples of projects that other students made from his homework using Post Script. Lauren managed to create nyan cat with it - pretty impressive!</p>

<p>Later at night, we went to CUNY to meet with another ‘alternative’ school based in Paris called <a href="http://iheap.fr/">IHEAP</a> for a discussion about <a href="http://centerforthehumanities.org/program/education-periphery-iheap-and-school-poetic-computation-conversation#sthash.81yaj8fu.dpuf%C2%A0">‘Education on the Periphery’</a> facilitated by Michael Mandiberg. Each school discussed their program and had students introduce themselves and talk a little about what they’re working on. They’re all doing cool stuff and they’re also planning on opening up another IHEAP in New York. After, we all went out for Korean BBQ.</p>
