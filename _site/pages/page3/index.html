	  <p class="post-content"><p>I spent most of today working on a grammar using plt.js for Ramsey’s class. It really frustrating at first, because I had to remember how to use regular expressions again, and it was pretty easy to break the code. After about a whole day of struggling, I finally got everything working which was really satisfying.</p>

<p>After lunch was Allison’s class - we had a great discussion about decentralization led by Christos which left me with a lot to think about. Still contemplating bitcoins…</p>

	<h3> 
	  <p class="post-content"><p>Out of all the readings, I liked Protocol and the Bitcoin stuff the best so I’ll comment on those.</p>

<p>Protocol addresses a lot of misconceptions I had about the web and also taught me a lot about it works as well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘How would control exist after decentralization?’ </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>It was interesting to read about the history of control in societies, about how there was a shift from disciplinary societies to control societies.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘World Wide Web is a network within the internet –&gt; HTML and CSS’  </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>This may sound stupid/silly, but if World Wide Web is a network within the internet…then what other networks are there and how do I find them?</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘Nearly all web traffic must submit to a hierarchical structure (DNS) to gain access to the anarchic and radically horizaontal structure of the internet’  </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>I still have trouble wrapping my head around how DNS is decentralized. Its hierarchical nature makes it seem like the weak link in this idea of decentralization, but the author doesn’t seem to have a problem with that. I was confused when given the example about how we can just shut off an entire country from the internet pretty easily. Am I missing something?</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘Next-hop strategy means that no single node on the internet knows definitively where a destination is, but each node does know the exact location of every node it is connected to.’ </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>This concept is super interesting, I feel like I learned some cool combinatorial theory that goes along with how this works in university. It’s amazing to understand that it can get to a very specific end point without knowing exactly where that end point is at every step in its journey. I guess if each and every step is absolutely ‘closer’ (I wonder how it knows what is closer?) then I guess it makes sense that it will eventually end up in the correct end point based on some optimzation algorithm or something.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before reading this, I didn’t really know what Bitcoin was, even though I’ve heard it mentioned a lot lately. It was fun to learn more.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘Bitcoin is an electrical payment system based on a mathematical proof’  </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>OMG MATH, I need to dig into this in more detail (nerd moment)! I’m really interested in the specifics of how it works! </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘Bitcoin as a global payment system anyone can use from anywhere at any time can be a powerful catalyst to extend the benefits of the modern economic system to virtually everyone on the planet.’</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>This seems great at first glance, but knowing the little that I know about bitcoin, you need technology to access it. What about those people that don’t have access to technology like we do? The article mentioned that bitcoin could be beneficial to impoverished countries and the poor, but how will they even get access to it?</li>
</ul>

<p>Bitcoin basically seems like a no bullshit way to perform transactions. It hides just enough but also gives us just enough. Right now, I’m liking bitcoin, but I know I still have a lot to learn about how it really works.</p>

<p>After today’s discussion, I realize that there are still a lot of political, social, economical issues that can and do arise from bitcoin use that I need to dive into more. I did agree with Jonas’s point though, that just because people are misusing it, doesn’t mean it can’t be considered a nice idea.</p>

	<h3> 
	  <p class="post-content"><p>We had a short check in with Tega this morning and then we got some studio time before Taeyoon’s class. I spent pretty much all of my studio time doing the readings for the CTOT class tomorrow, they were quite long this week but definitely interesting. </p>

<p>Taeyoon continued teaching us some more circuits stuff after lunch. We learned how to make an XOR logic gate, and then how to use an integrated circuit chip that was full of nand gates and looked like this:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/cockroachchip.png" alt="Cockroach chip" /></p>

<p>This chip lets you use nand gates to create a half adder! This means that you can add very simple binary numbers:</p>

<p>0 + 0 =  0 is 0 + 0 = 00<br />
0 + 1 =  0 is 0 + 1 = 01<br />
1 + 0 =  1 is 1 + 0 = 01<br />
1 + 1 = 10 is 1 + 1 = 10  </p>

<p>We can see that the least significant digit resembles the output for an XOR gate and the second (or leftmost digit) resembles the output for an AND gate. By combining these two logic gates, we can create a half adder that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/halfadder.jpg" alt="Half adder" /></p>

<p>We also spent some time creating AND, OR, NOR, and XOR gates using only the chip with NANDS:</p>

<p><img src="http://paigederaedt.github.io/blog/assets/andfromnands.jpg" alt="AND from NANDS" style="width:350px" />
<img src="http://paigederaedt.github.io/blog/assets/orfromnands.jpg" alt="OR from NANDS" style="width:350px" />  </p>

<p><img src="http://paigederaedt.github.io/blog/assets/norfromnands.jpg" alt="NOR from NANDS" style="width:350px" />
<img src="http://paigederaedt.github.io/blog/assets/xorfromnands.jpg" alt="XOR from NANDS" style="width:350px" /></p>

<p>After circuits class, <a href="http://www.davidhorvitz.com/">David Horvitz</a> came to speak for an artist talk. He’s a super chill guy and his work is very playful. I think my favorite piece he talked about was called ‘Public Access’. ‘Public Access’ included taking a road trip up the west coast and taking a picture of himself at all of the public access beaches. He took the photo so that only his back is showing. When he was done with the road trip, he went to the wikipedia pages for each location he visited and inserted the picture he took on the beach of himself into the article. Eventually Wikipedia found out what he was doing and ended up banning him from Wikipedia. He also focuses a lot of his work on the concept of time. One example is a project in which he sailed to the line where the pacific time zone ends and took water from the time zone border. He then recreated the time zone border in a few galleries. Overall, pretty interesting and hilarious stuff!</p>

<p>We then ended the day with a family dinner. Franc cooked some spanish omelettes for everyone which were AMAZING. We then had a little mini surprise celebration for his birthday coming up! Happy Birthday Franc!!!!</p>

	  <p class="post-content"><p>Today was another studio day, and a very productive one! I worked on writing/consolidating a lot of blog posts. This blog is finally in a presentable state! Now I can just worry about customizing and writing one post a day! I spent a good part of the day documenting all of my ideas on a <a href="https://sfpc.hackpad.com/Paiges-Thoughts-at-SFPC-iwo24nJ6eTv">personal hackpad</a>. It felt really good to get all of my thoughts consolidated in one place where I can get some feedback.</p>

<p>After lunch, Sarah led a terminal workshop which was pretty helpful. I definitely learned a few small tricks that I didn’t know before!</p>

<p>I spent the rest of the day working with Puzzlescript! <a href="http://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=0a701006213ee1a496a8">Here</a> is my creation!</p>

    <span class="post-meta">Oct 21, 2014</span>
 
	<h3> 
	  <p class="post-content"><p>Zach started the day with diving into the basics of animation. His main takeaway was that ‘We LOVE &lt;3 numbers between 0 and 1!’. We can use linear interpolation to get between two points: A and B.<br />
Formula: <code>(1 - percentage) * A + percentage * B</code><br />
You can raise percentages to a power which creates nonlinear movement and you can use [0-1] to mix things together. It becomes powerful for the concept of smoothing as well: Take some percentage of where you are and some percentage of where you want to go. Differnet percent ratios will decide how long your movement takes. When you have noisy data, this formula helps you ‘catch up’ to the data. Ex) If A is your noisy data, you can take some percentage of it and add it to some percentage of B, the place where you want to go. The percentage ratios indicate how fast you ‘catch up’ with the data….SO COOL!!!!</p>

<p>We then had a lunch talk with <a href="http://www.caitlinmorris.net/">Caitlin Morris</a>. She just finished a residency at <a href="http://www.fabrica.it/">Fabrica</a> in Italy. She focuses on technology as the means of an experience: technology that drives the experience rather than interfacing with technology directly.  She gave us a very summary of her work at Fabrica as well as her path to where she is now. She was just so sweet and relatable and made me feel like I could one day be doing something similar. </p>

<p>After this, Jonas let a workshop on node.js and showed us a bunch of <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs">cool modules</a> to use with it. Node.js is a chrome javascript engine that is taken out of the browser and put on the command line. It seems like a pretty powerful tool that may be able to replace python for me while helping me get more familiar with the web development.</p>

<p>I worked on circuits homework after this, and with a little bit of help from Taeyoon, I was able to create a buffer, not, and, or, nand, nor gates! I’m pretty sure I understand everything that’s going on as well! Unfortunately, there was one casualty in the process: goodbye mr. transistor…</p>

    <span class="post-meta">Oct 20, 2014</span>
 
	<h3> 
	  <p class="post-content"><p>Today was Zach’s first day back teaching after getting back from a project in Amsterdam. I was really excited for him to come back as I really want to learn some open frameworks from him. He started with check in where we talked with him about what we want to learn and what he feels comfortable teaching.</p>

<p>We then continued to go over some more of plt.js with Ramsey. We’re going to be writing out own languages really soon! One idea I already have is the concept of adding words, based on some linguistic concept - maybe sentiment? Adding two words will give you another with a sentiment value that equals the addition of the sentiment values for the two words. All mathematical operations could apply. Maybe you can have keywords for what kind of sentiment results you would want: objective vs subjective or positive vs negative. Andrew also showed us his game that he made with <a href="http://www.puzzlescript.net/">puzzlescript</a> that was pretty hilarious: <a href="http://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=91738939e15e393acd70">Fuck it</a>. I really want to make one that has to do with cats…we’ll see.</p>

<p>Zach started his intro to open frameworks at the end of the day. We went over it’s story, philosophy, and basic usage which served as intro to his class on animation!</p>

	       </h2>

    <span class="post-meta">Oct 17, 2014</span>
 
	<h3> 
	  <p class="post-content"><p>This is my first reading reflection post for my Critical Theory of Technology [CTOT] class. The reading that provoked the most thought for me this week was Mindstorms by Seymour Papert. (maybe also because it was the longest…) </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘It’s about using computers to to challenge current beliefs about who can understand what and at what age.’  </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>I do feel like I underestimate children’s ability to work with computers. Before this class, I was visiting some relatives at their cottage in northern Michigan and my younger cousin was playing Minecraft, and was insanely good at it (in my opinion). I was so amazed at what she could do in the game being so young (ages 4-7ish). Because I didn’t grow up having access to a computer at that age, it seems inconceivable that children that young can work with it so well.</li>
</ul>

<p>I really liked the analogy of learning to communicate with a computer to being exposed to and learning a language in another country. I’ve always wondered why it’s so much easier to learn a language through exposure rather than brute force teaching so it’s really interesting to relate learning a programming language to this. I also never really thought of learning programming in the same context as learning another language such as Spanish or French; maybe because programming isn’t usually spoken, only written?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘Breaking a vicious learning cycle without creating a dependence on machines’  </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>is very important. It’s great to teach children to communicate with a computer at a young age, but it shouldn’t replace any physical hands-on learning.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘Our culture has a general perception of mathematics as inaccessible.’  </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>I happened to really enjoy learning what the paper calls ‘school math’, but I knew plenty of people who had mathphobia as well. There was/is definitely a clear disconnect between skills: those who feel more comfortable in the ‘english/lit/creative’ world and those who feel more comfortable in the ‘analytical/math’ world, and they’re looked at as mutually exclusive spaces. I was lucky to somehow feel inspired by and have a natural affinity for math, but at the same time, I would say I had a writing phobia because of it. Because I was good at math throughout school, I automatically felt that I would not be a good writer and hated writing and literature classes. (Which is strange because I love to read and reflect on reading…) I think this inspires my gravitation towards computational linguistics as it makes language/writing as math-y as possible.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘Mathematics must be continuous with well established personal knowledge from which it can inherit a sense of warmth and value as well as cognitive competence.’  </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>I’ve been thinking a lot about why I like math since reading this paper, and I don’t know if I can articulate why yet…I was taught what the paper calls ‘school math’ and I don’t feel like I had much of a chance or was encouraged to find relevance to something personal, as the author did with gears. In college, what distinguished math from other classes for me was that it was learning and understanding a process rather then memorizing facts. So why do I like math enough to get a degree in it? I don’t quite know.</li>

          <a class="post-link" href="/blog/jekyll/update/2014/10/17/TimeWithSara.html">More time with Sara*</a>
	       </h2>

    <span class="post-meta">Oct 17, 2014</span>
 
	<h3> 
	  <p class="post-content"><p>We started off Friday with some more discussion on assistive technology as well as more general feelings/concerns about the creative process at SFPC with Sara. All I can say is that she is remarkable. Each student had the chance to spend some 1:1 time with her as well. I was initially really nervous about this as I am with most interactions with amazing people, but she was so incredibly sincere. I felt pretty comfortable from the moment she started asking me questions. I focused my time with her on discussing 2 main tracks for project ideas that I have: crocheting + code and language + code. I started with my crocheting + code idea, and explained to her my concern of it falling flat with it being hard to create anything more substantial than an image crocheted in the shape of a rectangle. There’s been some projects with knitting machines that will generate complex patterns but that takes a lot of the hands on work out which I wanted to preserve with my idea. My idea would be to have the user submit an image and the tool would abstract the image in some way based on parameters that could control the difficult level: how detailed, number of colors, scale, etc. After all this was specified then the tool would generate a pattern and list of instructions so that the user could hand crochet an image. Sara didn’t seem too concerned with the final piece always being in the form of a rectangle and mentioned that they could just live as tapestry projects.</p>

<p>I also shared with her my idea to make language more math-y. There’s been a huge focus in this class on education - I like this. There’s a culturally imposed divide of skills that people can have: If you’re good at reading/writing then you’re probably not good at math; if you’re good at math then you’re probably not good at reading/writing. Most of the focus is centered on improving the way we teach people math/programming and making technology more accessible to them as its use becomes more prevalent in the world. I was lucky that math always clicked for me in school and I enjoyed it enough to study it at university. However, knowing that I liked math imposed an inherent lack of ability to write - I was terrified of english and lit classes. It was weird though, because I loved to read. I didn’t really understand this disconnect fully until I came to SFPC. I made my circle visualization that I presented at the welcome party before coming or even knowing about SFPC based on pure curiosity. I didn’t really have a clear intention of why I was doing it at the time. But after thinking more about it during my time here, I realized it was my attempt to make writing more math-y. This was the only way I could be comfortable with it. Thinking back, it also explains why I was so interested in my previous work experience at a startup whose products were built with natural language processing and linguistics concepts. IT’S ALL STARTING TO MAKE SENSE! So one project idea that I have is trying to make language more math-y, to help people like me and also other engineers for whom writing a paper was freaking huge deal in university. I guess this is my perspective on a ‘new audience’. Sara was super excited about this idea which made me really excited. I was nervous about this one falling short and so that’s why I started to think abot doing something more hands on like crocheting. She mentioned that it was a unique perspective and challenged me to focus on younger audiences. She thought it would be interesting to create a few pieces that could live as ‘pretty’ visualizations, but also serve as a teaching tool to make language more accesible to technical people. She mentioned to approach it from a space where I wasn’t claiming that this is an answer to problems in education, but rather a study to see what we can learn from making language more math-y. </p>

<p>Moral of the story: Sara is awesome and I felt really empowered after speaking with her. She gave me the confidence I needed to really dig into this idea. Thank you Sara!</p>

<p>I’ve also documented these ideas in more detail <a href="https://sfpc.hackpad.com/Paiges-Thoughts-at-SFPC-iwo24nJ6eTv">here</a>.</p>

	  <p class="post-content"><p>Today was Taeyoon’s first hardware class! We started with learning logic gates and their associated truth tables, and then we moved on the building their equivalent circuits (simple switch, buffer, not gate, and gate, or gate, nand gate, nor gate). This was pretty overwhelming as I have never touched circuits or hardware before, but after taking some time to digest and review logic gates with Rachel and Zan things started to make a little more sense. I got as far as creating the buffer with some help from Jonas and Zach.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/firstcircuit.jpg" alt="My first circuit" /></p>

<p>After class, Sara Hendren spoke about her perspective and <a href="http://ablersite.org/">journalism</a> work in the assistive technology space. She challenges the idea of disability and assitive technology and proposes questions about what really is considered assistive technology - Is all technology assistive technology? Is being deaf, blind, short, etc. a disability? - it depends on your perseptive. Overall, she left us with a lot to think about.</p>

	  <p class="post-content"><p>Ida introed her work to us for check in this morning. She started by telling us to pick a partner. We were to follow that partner around outside, but in a way that no one else on the street would notice. When our partner stopped walking, we would switch roles, so that the follower became the leader. We were to do this for 12 minutes and switch roles at least 3 times during that period. Rachel and I were partners - we did pretty well, and only lost each other once at the end…we weren’t totally in line with how to handle stopping for a cross walk. Ida challenged us to think about what we noticed that we wouldn’t normally notice when we walk down the street every day, and how we can learn something about ourselves and others through this.</p>

<p>She then continued to introduce her work as an Experience Designer - and by Experience Designer, I don’t mean what you would normally think of. She designs adventures for a carefully chosen group of people in highly researched locations. I don’t know if my explanation will do her work justice, but here’s a try explaining a project where she created a speakeasy in a water tower: The guest list consisted just of her team and friends at first, but then continued to change. Each guest was given the opportunity to purchase admission for another individual as a gift. This gift came in the form of a pocketwatch that had very simple directions along the line of ‘call this number to make a reservation’. Each pocketwatch ticket would admit two people. Over time, people passed on these pocketwatch admission tickets to their closest and most respected friends. After 7 months, celebrities started showing up so they had to shut it down before the secret was let out as everything happening was illegal. That’s just one awesome example, but check out her <a href="http://uncommonplaces.com">website</a> for more.</p>

<p>Ramsey’s class was next. We reviewed our brainfuck assignments…it’s super hard to write in. I figured out one trick and used that for pretty much everything, but here’s what I created:</p>

<p><strong>My name in brainfuck:</strong><br />
<code>
++++++++[&gt;++[&gt;+++++&lt;-]&lt;-]&gt;&gt;.
&gt;+++++++++++[&gt;+++[&gt;+++&lt;-]&lt;-]&gt;&gt;--.
&gt;+++++[&gt;++++[&gt;+++++&gt;+++++&gt;+++++&lt;&lt;&lt;-]&lt;-]&gt;&gt;+++++.&gt;+++.&gt;+.
</code></p>

<p><strong>‘I love you!’:</strong><br />
<code>
+++++++[&gt;++[&gt;+++++&lt;-]&lt;-]&gt;&gt;+++.
&gt;++++[&gt;++++++++&lt;-]&gt;.
&gt;+++++++++++[&gt;+++++[&gt;++&gt;++&gt;++&gt;++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;-]&lt;-]
&gt;&gt;--.&gt;+.&gt;++++++++.&gt;---------.
&gt;++++[&gt;++++++++&lt;-]&gt;.
&gt;++++++++++++[&gt;+++++[&gt;++&gt;++&gt;++&lt;&lt;&lt;-]&lt;-]&gt;&gt;+.&gt;---------.&gt;---.
&gt;++++[&gt;++++++++&lt;-]&gt;+.
</code></p>

<p><strong>Counting from 1-10:</strong><br />
<code>
++++[&gt;+++[&gt;++++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;++++&gt;&gt;++++&gt;&gt;++++&gt;&gt;++++&gt;&gt;+++++&gt;&gt;+++++&gt;&gt;+++++&gt;&gt;+++++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;-]&lt;-]&gt;&gt;+.
&gt;++[&gt;++++[&gt;++++&gt;&gt;++++&gt;&gt;++++&gt;&gt;++++&gt;&gt;++++&gt;&gt;++++&gt;&gt;++++&gt;&gt;++++&gt;&gt;++++&gt;&gt;++++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;-]&lt;-]
&gt;&gt;.&gt;++.&gt;.&gt;+++.&gt;.&gt;++++.&gt;.&gt;+++++.&gt;.&gt;------.&gt;.&gt;-----.&gt;.&gt;----.&gt;.&gt;---.&gt;.
&gt;&gt;&gt;++++[&gt;+++[&gt;++++&gt;++++&lt;&lt;-]&lt;-]&gt;&gt;+.&gt;.

<p>We continued to talk about how to start writing our own programming languages. Ramsey introduced us to the tool that he made called <a href="https://github.com/nasser/pltjs">plt.js</a> that lets you create your own language on top of javascript using grammars.</p>
