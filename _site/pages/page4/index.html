	  <p class="post-content"><p>Today was our second studio day. We started with a stand up style check in on the second floor porch. We all brought or talked about a book we wanted to share with the class. I talked about <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=house+of+leaves&amp;es_sm=119&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ddxHVJGDNajlsATuoIKwDw&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1186&amp;bih=720">‘House of Leaves’</a> by Mark Danielewski because of it’s really interesting text layouts on each page. Everyone else shared some awesome books as well! </p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/booksharing1.png" alt="Book sharing" /></p>

<p>After this we listed to Zan demo a talk she is doing in November about Simpson’s paradox. She demoed a new chart style she created with <a href="http://www.bewitched.com/">Martin Wattenberg</a> to better visualize data so that this effect becomes more apparent. The paper that the talk about can be found <a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/42901.pdf">here</a> </p>

<p>The rest of the day was pretty standard studio…just continued to work on creating my circos visualization in d3.</p>

	  <p class="post-content"><p>Taeyoon started check in today with diving more into what we wanted to do for the Silent Barn event. He quickly switched topics to Aram’s talk which sparked a pretty rich discussion that questioned the integrity of his work. Some students thought his work was shallow and didn’t have deep intentions or meanings - they were more of just one note jokes that don’t really resonate. Others felt that his intention and strategic choices lent to more depth than initially seen on the outside and so respected/appreciated his work. I had mixed opinions. There were some pieces that I thought were sort of shallow and lacked depth, but after hearing everyone talk, I began to see more depth in them. Overall, I think I appreciate his work. </p>

<p>We continued the day with Ramsey’s class, where he introduced us to some esoteric programming languages and gave us homework to complete a few challenges in brainfuck. We’ll see how that goes…</p>

<p>We ended the day with a Crocheting/Knitting workshop that Lauren, Rachel, and I ran. We taught Toru, Yuki, and Zan the basics of crocheting which included casting on, slip stitches, single, double, and triple crochet, as well as crocheting circles. It was really fun! It was nice to be able to share knowledge with other students and many realized that they liked crocheting a lot! It also made me think more about focusing a project on crocheting during my time at SFPC.</p>

	<h3> 
	  <p class="post-content"><p>We started with morning with an artist talk from <a href="http://piavangelder.com/">Pia Van Gelder</a>. She walked us through her journey of interest in sound and heirloom technologies. A project that was especially interesting was the psychic synth, which read your alpha and beta brain waves to produce a sound and light show. The math behind it was pretty intriguing - her collaborater used some sort of fractal analysis!</p>

<p>Allison’s first <a href="https://github.com/allisonburtch/Critical-Theory-of-Technology">Critical Theory of Technology</a> class was this afternoon. I’m excited about this class because I have a feeling that we’re going to read a lot of the pieces that I was assigned for a similar class in university but didn’t read (whoops…), so this is my chance to really dig into them! We started by introducing ourselves and identifying what we wanted to get out of the class/desired areas of focus. I mentioned that I’d like to focus on the concept of a digital divide, and how technology is really only accessible to those who can pay for it. </p>

<p>We finished the class by watching <a href="https://vimeo.com/38724174">‘All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace’</a> which really got me thinking. It was a pretty depressing film and I’m still not quite sure how to process it all/what to think - maybe I’ll have to watch it again…</p>

<p>This weekend will also be really busy: a bunch of us plan to go to the opening of Eyebeam and Zan and I are also going to the Robotic Church on Saturday. On Sunday, Zan, Rachel, and I are planning to go to the Brooklyn Museum.</p>

<p>Here are some photos from the trips:<br />

He’s pretty awesome - check out his work <a href="http://taeyoonchoi.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Later that night, <a href="http://datenform.de/">Aram Bartholl</a> spoke as our visiting artist. I really enjoyed his playful and humorous work and appreciated his theme of bringing the digital world back into the physical world. I think my favorite was his google street view car project.</p>

	  <p class="post-content"><p>I slacked on doing blog posts for the next week, but I still want to remember what I did each day, so this is me going back after the fact and writing down what I remember before it gets too late. All posts done in this fashion will be denoted by a *.</p>

<p>Today began with studio as there wasn’t a check in. After struggling some more with the d3 version of my circos visualization, Ramsey’s class started. We had a few readings for class, my favorite was the <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">Wat talk</a> which comments on some silly decisions that were made when writing some commonly used programming languages.</p>

<p>In the evening, <a href="http://pitaru.com/">Amit’s</a> intro happened. It was basically a discussion about his ideas for his time with us and his teaching philosophy. He challenges traditional education and examines how we can better help people understand programming. He talked about how the learning curve for programming is pretty easy at first but then gets really hard, and how most people aren’t taught how to overcome this stage in the curve. Many give up and think they will never be capable. The reality is that it is hard - and that’s okay, but we have to be taught to deal with that. He’ll work with a group of ‘Kitchen Table Coders’ (only those who can fit around his kitchen table) to understand how this education gap can be overcome.</p>

	  <p class="post-content"><p>Today was considered our first studio day. Taeyoon started the day with a check in and went over all the events that SFPC will be participating in this term. All seem really awesome. He encourages us to present at some but not all of them, and I know I’ll have to push myself out of my comfort zone in order to do this. I spent some time looking at the generative design book which has a bunch of processing tutorials - I focused on the text section and worked through some fun stuff. </p>

<p>I asked Jonas what he was working on and he showed me this <a href="https://github.com/halfdanj/connectedworld">tool</a> he made that visualized what servers your computer was pinging all over the world. He got it working in a day with node.js and d3 which is pretty amazing. Zan showed me a few things she’s done in d3 and introduced me to the examples page and <a href="http://bl.ocks.org">bl.ocks.org</a> which had some <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062006">chord diagrams</a> very similar to my circos visualization. I’m going to try to use it to animate my circos visualization. Overall, I felt pretty overwhelmed/anxious today. I was introduced to a lot of new information and tools and got a chance to see what others were working on. Everyone is working on interesting mini projects and I want to be able to create something cool too. </p>

<p>Over lunch, Lauren mentioned a workshop for women in tech that she went to that focused the first half enirely on understanding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">imposter syndrome</a> and that totally clicked with me because I feel like that’s what happening to me here at SFPC, but I know I need to change that fast. I spent the rest of today thinking about the themes, my ideas, and generating new inspirations. Looking forward to see what happens!</p>

	  <p class="post-content"><p>This was Ramsey’s first teaching day. He spent some time going over what he had planned for his class called <a href="http://radicalcomputerscience.tumblr.com/">‘Radical Computer Science’</a> and also went over his prior and current work. He studies the politics of code by focusing on the more meta stuff, like creating his own coding languages. He really helped me think about code in a way that the creator would by forcing us to understand the decisions that are made in writing a new language. He has created an arabic coding language as well as God.js, which I really enjoyed.</p>

<p>He ended his class by proposing an exercise where we had to code out an image of an iconic dance from <a href="http://dancingplagueof1518.tumblr.com/post/18072481062">this site</a>. Someone acted as the computer (the interpreter) and someone acted as the programmer. We basically wrote out how to perform the dance for another student. I read mine out while Nathan performed. He did a great job and it was pretty funny. He danced Napoleon Dynamite’s Canned Heat. </p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/cannedheat.jpg" alt="Canned Heat" /></p>

<p>As homework, Ramsey gave us the exercise of finding a piece we liked from the <a href="https://twitter.com/greatartbot">Twitter Great Art Bot</a> and then designing a language to create the image we chose. I felt like I was just writing a bunch of functions, or even a library, than a language. It was hard for me to draw the line about where to make assumptions about what you can/can’t do. I don’t know if I’ve really wrapped my head around it yet…</p>

	  <p class="post-content"><p>Zach gave us a tools lecture today - he basically showed us all of these amazing tools (programming languages) to try out and experiment with. Some were so simplistic, yet they could do so much! He showed us <a href="http://www.contextfreeart.org/">Context Free</a>, <a href="http://nodebox.net/">NodeBox</a>, <a href="http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/">SuperCollider</a>, and <a href="http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/">Chuck</a>. Context Free and NodeBox were viz tools and SuperCollider and Chuck were sound tools. Zach gave us homework to find a tool that noone else is using and experiment with it for the next week. We spent the rest of the day experimenting with the tools and working on our presentations. All of us did a rehearsal of the presentations and then got ready for the welcome party. There were about 100 people who showed up with some pretty amazing people in the audience (Jer Thorpe). I was super nervous to present in front of that many people, but it was also sort of exhilarating at the same time! So glad I did it but so glad it’s over. I also received a lot of really supportive encouragement from other students which was really nice. It was such a great week!</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/blog/jekyll/update/2014/10/02/BinaryNumbers.html">Binary Numbers</a>
	       </h2>

    <span class="post-meta">Oct 2, 2014</span>
 
	<h3> 
	  <p class="post-content"><p>Today we started learning about binary numbers with Zach. Starting with the basics. I had learned a little bit of binary numbers in university but didn’t have a good foundation, so this was a great refresher. We learned about the most significant vs the least significant digits. We looked at a visualization that took your webcam picture (in black and white) and visualized it based on each bit: what this means is that the color of each pixel was determined by bit ‘n’ (1 –&gt; 8). We were able to see how the least significant digit holds the least information about the image, as the image created by choosing the pixel color from the least significant digit provided the most ambiguous image. Zan explained it in this way and it really made it click for me, so thank you Zan! </p>

<p>We finished up the day by designing a game/process to teach an 8/80 year old binary numbers. I worked with Zach and Rachel to think about Zach’s idea of using legs to act as on/off switches. We ended up designing a game that required 8 people, 1 to act as each bit in the byte. There were two rules in the game: 1. You can only move forwards and backwards (only alternating –&gt; you can’t move forward twice) 2. you have to make a move when the person to the right steps back. The idea is that the least significant digit is always moving back and forth, and the rest of the places/people follow suit based on the rules. The game is meant to help show how to count up in binary and also to understand how significant each digit is. An alternative to this is to have the people start moving, and then randomly call stop. When stopped, they must say what binary number they are at (but in base 10). </p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/binarydance.jpeg" alt="Binary Numbers Dance" /></p>

<p>We also supplemented this with a game that helps you create a binary number that is equivalent to a base 10 number. it consisted of a line of ‘switches’ labeled with their 2^n = # starting at 128 and ending at 1. the idea was to take the number given, and start at the left (128) and ask if your number was lower, if yes, then flip the switch on, if no, go on. Each time you flip a switch, you subtract the number on the switch from your number and keep a running total until you get to zero. Once at zero, you are done, and you can see your binary number based on which switches are flipped.</p>

	  <p class="post-content"><p>Today was my  first day at the <a href="http://sfpc.io">School for Poetic Computation</a> [SFPC], and it was amazing! It started with basic mingling and administration stuff, but I can’t articulate my excitement for what’s in the works. One of the founders, <a href="http://thesystemis.com/">Zach Lieberman</a>, said ‘We work for you’ which was surprising, awesome, and extremely refreshing. The amount of ownership we have in this research experiment is pretty empowering. Zach and the other founder, Taeyoon, handpicked this amazing bunch of indivuals which I’m very proud, intimidated, and lucky to be a part of. Everyone is friendly and diverse, coming from a huge range of experience levels, backgrounds, and locations. There are a few students who are coming to America for the first time for SFPC - and I can’t even fathom what that’s like - kudos to you guys! I am surrounded by so many extremely talented artists, designers, coders, and makers, and I’m incredibly excited to learn from all of them. I hope that I can contribute some perspective and expertise as well!</p>

<p>We spent the second half of the day experimenting with human fax maachines. Toru, Meghana, Christos, and I had to design a way to decode and encode an image between two groups of people. We started with simple shapes, graduated to shapes with diagonals, and then with curves. We even thought about freeform shapes as well. It’s amazing what complex images you can translate with such minimal rules!</p>

<p>We finished with a dinner in the 2nd floor kitchen which consisted of homemade salads and himalayan food - it was my first time with himilayan food and it was pretty good! I listened in on a great conversation with Lauren and Christos about their backgrounds and opinions in news/publishing/advertising. Both have some really interesting experience and thoughts about the polictics of those fields. Day one is over and I’ve already learned so much!</p>
