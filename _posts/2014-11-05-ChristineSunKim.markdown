Today was partly studio again - it was nice to continue working on my particle system of words. Thanks to some help from Toru, I got the colors working how I want them to!

After lunch we had an artist talk with [Christine Sun Kim](http://christinesunkim.com/). She is most well known for being a deaf sound artist, which is pretty cool. Although her work was amazing, the experience of her talk with the translator was equally fascinating. The way her translator acted as her audible outlet was exactly as I would have pictured Christine talking aloud, in terms of the expression and way she delivered her words. I also just love the energy of sign language - Christine explained a lot about deaf culture and sign language through her pieces which was great. Something that was also equally refreshing: Christine was the first artist to reveal some work in progress ideas and very sincerely ask us for feedback in a non superficial way. It was nice that we were able to give her suggestions that she was actually writing down and taking into account.
