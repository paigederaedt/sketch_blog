As a way of summarizing and sharing our experiences at SFPC, we've been asked to complete a learning report by answering 4 of the following questions in 200 words or less:  

*What are some of your memorable learning experiences at the school?  
*What are some things you created during the school? Please provide a brief description and a link.   
*What would you like to teach and share after the school? and how would you like to teach?  
*What questions are you leaving the school with?  What questions did you come in with?  
*What do you want the school to become?  
*What would you like to be doing one year from now? and five years from now?  
*What would you tell the person you were a year ago?  
*What is going on with this world and how do you make stuff in it?  
*If you could have one computational super power, what would it be? How would you use it to create?  
*What is poetic computation?   

Here are the few I've chosen to reflect on:

What are some of your memorable learning experiences at the school? 

I don't know that I can begin to quantify how much I've learned at SFPC. It has been one of the richest experiences I've had to date. Although I've been exposed to countless new technologies and tools to play with, my most memorable learning experiences have been those that weren’t technical, which really surprised me as I was reflecting on the answer to this question. I gained confidence in being forced to present work at our welcome party in front of a ton of people. I gained perspective in learning how much time goes into all these amazing projects we’re exposed to through our teachers and artist talks. It’s okay to start from a foreign place. It’s okay that it doesn’t work out - look at a failed direction as a new inspiration. I gained strength in my ideas through encouragement, reflection, and stimulation. I’ve been humbled over and over again by the talented students I’m surrounded by, and I’ve really enjoyed the few times I’ve (hopefully) been able to help them. I’ve truly loved learning for the sake of learning and I know what I want education to be. 

What are some things you created during the school? Please provide a brief description and a link. 

I came into SFPC with a project inspired by Martin Kryswinski’s [work](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/pi/art/) where he visualizes the number pi by looking at the transition sequence of pi’s digits after the decimal place. I thought it may be interesting to visualize the sequence of letters in text. I originally used circos for the visualization that produces a static output, but have since worked on animating it using d3. To gain a little more background on the intentions and ideas behind this and directions of other work at SFPC, check out my [blog post](http://paigederaedt.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2014/10/17/TimeWithSara.html).

The next few explorations were a result of Zach Lieberman’s assignments to ‘jam’ after some classes on: 
Animation:
John Whitney inspired animation
We were also asked to animate a ‘creature’. I animated what kind of turned out to act like a family of butterflies, although that wasn’t the original intention.
Particle systems: 
My word particles experiment is further exploring my interest in text and code. I thought it would be cool to experiment with particle systems of words and manipulate the forces between them based on linguistic properties. My first iteration uses forces based on Levenshtein distance.
Image generation and manipulation:
And openGL:
Sphere viz

I also created an LED pin as an example for our Silent Barn Poetic Science Fair workshop. Lately, making this has really inspired me to think about how my love for being crafty can be combined with technology in interesting ways, maybe wearables?


What questions are you leaving the school with?  What questions did you come in with?

The main question I’m leaving the school with is how can I keep doing what I’m doing at SFPC? Before SFPC I graduated from undergrad and got a job at a startup that did a lot of work with computational linguistics and natural language processing. I really loved working there, but they unfortunately failed after about 4 months. I ended up with a more ‘traditional’ job as an analyst at Citrix, but I was pretty unhappy in the corporate world. SFPC has been a stark and refreshing contrast. I remember telling Casey, our admin, about halfway through the 10 weeks that I didn’t want to go back to a traditional job, or at least a job like I had in the past. How can I find the type of learning and openness to experimentation my future career? Can I be fulfilled with a traditional job? Is freelance or returning to school the best option? 

More specific to my interests: How can I combine my interest with language, text, and code with my interest in sewing and crocheting? My math/stats background lends itself to data visualization – how can I fit that in?

Questions I came in with mostly focused on how I can combine by learned math/stats background with my passion for art and being crafty. I think SFPC has given me a short term glance into how this can happen, but now I need a long term execution plan.


What would you tell the person you were a year ago?
