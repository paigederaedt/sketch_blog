Today was Taeyoon's first hardware class! We started with learning logic gates and their associated truth tables, and then we moved on the building their equivalent circuits (simple switch, buffer, not gate, and gate, or gate, nand gate, nor gate). This was pretty overwhelming as I have never touched circuits or hardware before, but after taking some time to digest and review logic gates with Rachel and Zan things started to make a little more sense. I got as far as creating the buffer with some help from Jonas and Zach.

After class, Sara Hendren spoke about her perspective and [journalism](http://ablersite.org/) work in the assistive technology space. She challenges the idea of disability and assitive technology and proposes questions about what really is considered assistive technology - Is all technology assistive technology? Is being deaf, blind, short, etc. a disability? - it depends on your perseptive. Overall, she left us with a lot to think about.
