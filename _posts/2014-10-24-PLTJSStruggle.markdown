I spent most of today working on a grammar using plt.js for Ramsey's class. It really frustrating at first, because I had to remember how to use regular expressions again, and it was pretty easy to break the code. After about a whole day of struggling, I finally got everything working which was really satisfying.

After lunch was Allison's class - we had a great discussion about decentralization led by Christos which left me with a lot to think about. Still contemplating bitcoins...
