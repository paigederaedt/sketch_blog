Zach led a session on image generation and manipulation today. Like all his classes, the techniques are super fun. I do feel like I have a little bit of a block in terms of image generation right now. I can't really get behavior that I'm looking for, but I know that will just come with practice. I'm really excited to try out image manipulation though. It'd be really awesome to do something with image manipulation and text. I was thinking about manipulating images of a picture book based on the text on the page - maybe pick a classic children's book? 

Here's a few examples of some images I generated today:  

![img gen 1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/imggen1.png)  

![img gen 2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/imggen2.png)  

![img gen 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/imggen3.png)

After lunch, Ramsey spent some time with us on shaders. I still feel completely lost to how they work to be honest, but I think I just need more context. All I know is that they can create some pretty awesomely efficient visuals in terms of computation. They're also apparently the future of programming! Better get on that...
