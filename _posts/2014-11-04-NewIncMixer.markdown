Today Zach went over some more particle systems stuff. Most of it included working with vector fields. I'm still having trouble figuring out how he's implemented them, but I need to look into it more. They can be used to deal with interaction really nicely, and it really makes me want to incorporate using my webcam to manipulate my word particle system somehow.

I spent the rest of today working on my word particle system. I think it's coming along nicely. I've figured out how to get live typing to work, but I'm having trouble integrating any language processing I'm doing in python with my open frameworks sketch. Hopefully I can get something working soon.

Later today we had a mixer at the New Museum with [New Inc](http://newinc.org/). They're kind of like an artist, hacker, and startup community combined, which I think is a nice idea. No one is forced to work together and I don't know that participation is project based, but the idea is to just have all these different groups of people accessible to each other and see what happens. Everyone there was super nice and interesting, and we even got to hear a few of them speak along with other SFPC students. 

After that, a few of us went to grab some dinner at Cafe Habana. They have some pretty great burritos, but are apparently known for their corn which I didn't know until after I ordered...oh well, for another time!
