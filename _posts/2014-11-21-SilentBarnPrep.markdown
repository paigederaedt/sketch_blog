I spent most of the morning finishing up the readings for Allison's class, where we had a great discussion on privacy and surveillance, but after that, we spent some time preparing our LED throwie examples for Silent Barn. This was so much fun! I really miss working with fabric and sewing and just doing crafty things. Rachel made a fried egg pin, Yuki made a bicycle, and Lauren made a name tag all with LEDs incorporated. Hopefully the kids can get some good inspiration from them at Silent Barn on Sunday!

Here's some photos of the hair clip I made without the LEDs (they'll be added on Sunday!):
