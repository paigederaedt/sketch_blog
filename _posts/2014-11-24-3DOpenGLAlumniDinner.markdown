Today Zach taught us about drawing and animating in 3D using nodes and meshes. He wants us to love nodes as much as he does, and so far they seem pretty awesome. I'm definitely looking forward to continuing to play around with them. I also really want to play around with creating 3D surfaces and objects based on data, maybe text? I'll have to figure out how to translate text into some sort of 3D surface in a cool way.

Tega organized a dinner with New Inc and SFPC alumni later on. We all joined in to help cook what turned out to be a really awesome vegetable curry. It was nice to hang out and chat after a long day with students and friends of SFPC.
