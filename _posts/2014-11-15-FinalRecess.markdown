The last day of recess ended at the Siempre Verde garden. This is an urban garden run by members of the community. It's super close to SFPC and most probably wouldn't notice it when just walking by, but it really is a beautiful space. We had a gardener who put a lot of work into preserving the land for the garden speak about all the trouble one has to go through to preserve a space like this in the city from being developed over. A super interesting and inspiring story and a great way to end the last recess.
