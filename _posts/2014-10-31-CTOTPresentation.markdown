Today was mostly spent preparing for Rachel and mine's presentation for our Critical Theory of Technology class. This week the theme was Sci-Fi and Utopias which was pretty fun...or not, depending on how you think about it. I really enjoyed the readings, but had a lot of anxiety about presenting. Overall, I think it went okay...just glad we got it over with. There's a link to the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TCJAZSSWi3e0ht6U4TpSRiFKcyC78pbW2r-hZyHBQbM/edit?usp=sharing) as well as in my next post for the CTOT class.

Happy Halloween!!!
