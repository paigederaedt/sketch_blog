Today was another animation class with Zach - he gave us some time to 'jam' with the animation homework he gave us which was pretty fun.

After this we had a workshop with one of the creators of [Spacebrew](http://docs.spacebrew.cc/). He showed us how he used Kyle McDonald's face recognition software to turn a light on and off by winking into your webcam. And that's just the beginning of what you can do with Spacebrew. We spent some time getting comfortable with the interface and integrating with Processing. He also showed us how to set up our own node.js server to keep any applications we make running on the web for interaction. It was super fun and I've had so many thoughts about what you could do with it so far!
