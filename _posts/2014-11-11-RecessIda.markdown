Zach started off this morning with a class on text processing which I was SUPER excited about. He did a little website scraping with Beautiful Soup which was a nice refresher since I usually use regex. He also showed us some ways to analyze text like the Levenshtein distance which measures the 'distance' between words. I think I want to use this in my particle system sketch to control forces between words - maybe words that are 'closer' to each other could have a greater attraction to each other?

We finished the day with Ida's first recess field trip. We started off by checking out the remains of some abandoned subway stops that were build using the neumatic system. You can see them if you look out the window on the 6 line.

Next we made our way to the New York public library to find out that it was unfortunately closed because of Veteran's day. They have some remains from the neumatic mail system that used to be used in Manhattan. We finished the trip by taking an air tram to Roosevelt Island. Wonder why? They apparently use a neumatic system for their trash. Overall a super fun day with great weather!
