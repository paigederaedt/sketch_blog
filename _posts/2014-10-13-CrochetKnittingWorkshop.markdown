Taeyoon started check in today with diving more into what we wanted to do for the Silent Barn event. He quickly switched topics to Aram's talk which sparked a pretty rich discussion that questioned the integrity of his work. Some students thought his work was shallow and didn't have deep intentions or meanings - they were more of just one note jokes that don't really resonate. Others felt that his intention and strategic choices lent to more depth than initially seen on the outside and so respected/appreciated his work. I had mixed opinions. There were some pieces that I thought were sort of shallow and lacked depth, but after hearing everyone talk, I began to see more depth in them. Overall, I think I appreciate his work. 

We continued the day with Ramsey's class, where he introduced us to some esoteric programming languages and gave us homework to complete a few challenges in brainfuck. We'll see how that goes...

We ended the day with a Crocheting/Knitting workshop that Lauren, Rachel, and I ran. We taught Toru, Yuki, and Zan the basics of crocheting which included casting on, slip stitches, single, double, and triple crochet, as well as crocheting circles. It was really fun! It was nice to be able to share knowledge with other students and many realized that they liked crocheting a lot! It also made me think more about focusing a project on crocheting during my time at SFPC.
