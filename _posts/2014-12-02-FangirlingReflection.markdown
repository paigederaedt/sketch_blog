We started today with a checkin with Taeyoon and Ida where they introduced us to the plans for the final wrap up session. I can tell they've both put a lot of thought into giving us the most out of our time here and come up with a pretty awesome experience for us. They've curated a list of amazing people to serve as mentors for us to meet with and discuss any questions we have about ideas, direction of work, or career. The day will consist of two mentoring sessions with a few mixer/coffee breaks in between so that we can speak with any mentors we didn't have a chance to talk to more closely. After seeing the list of mentors I'm pretty much freaking out. They're all so incredible and I'm really excited and anxious to be able to get their feedback.

I spent the rest of the day working on an SFPC learning report that we've been asked to complete in preparation for our mentoring sessions. It will be given to the mentors beforehand so that they can learn a little more about what we've been thinking about and working on during our time at SFPC. Working on the report has been a lot harder than expected, but I'm really getting a lot out of reflecting on my time here. (It also makes me super thankful that I've been keeping up this blog!)
