Today was Taeyoon's intro to his work, he showed us the range of projects he's worked on, from the [Sharing Faces](https://vimeo.com/96549043) project to creating simple and playful wall street robot protestors. He's pretty awesome - check out his work [here](http://taeyoonchoi.com/).

Later that night, [Aram Bartholl](http://datenform.de/) spoke as our visiting artist. I really enjoyed his playful and humorous work and appreciated his theme of bringing the digital world back into the physical world. I think my favorite was his google street view car project.
