Taeyoon had a drawing + circuits class today which was super fun. At first his classes are always really overwhelming because I usually have no idea what the heck is going on. Once I spent some time with it and asked Taeyoon a few questions, I was feeling a lot better. I think it really helped to make drawing a part of the class because it really forced you to consider whether or not you fully understood the concepts - or at least enough to draw them out in a way that makes sense. Today's lesson was focused on memory. We created a circuit with 2 switches - one switched and LED on and off as expected, and when a second switch was activated, it held the condition of the LED. So satisfying, even if it was a super basic memory model.
