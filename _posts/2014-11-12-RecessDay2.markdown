Today was our first full day recess with Ida. Our first stop was the Greenwood cemetery. Ida's friend gave us a tour and taught us a lot about the history of the people buried there, the differnet tomb styles, and the crazy plants originally intended as a small decoration that have taken over a ton of space.

Next we took a nice long stroll through Red Hook and checked out the Gowanus Canal which is heavily polluted...although it really doesn't look too bad.

Finally, we ended the day at a Leigh Valley barge. This barge celebrates its 100th birthday this year which is so cool! It's been docked in New York for the past 20 years and has served as a museum, performance boat, and home to it's owner who is a professional juggler.

We ended the day relaxing and playing around on some sculptures while waiting for the ferry to take us back to Manhattan.
