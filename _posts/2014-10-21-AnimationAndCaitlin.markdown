Zach started the day with diving into the basics of animation. His main takeaway was that 'We LOVE <3 numbers between 0 and 1!'. We can use linear interpolation to get between two points: A and B.  
Formula: ````(1 - percentage) * A + percentage * B````  
You can raise percentages to a power which creates nonlinear movement and you can use [0-1] to mix things together. It becomes powerful for the concept of smoothing as well: Take some percentage of where you are and some percentage of where you want to go. Differnet percent ratios will decide how long your movement takes. When you have noisy data, this formula helps you 'catch up' to the data. Ex) If A is your noisy data, you can take some percentage of it and add it to some percentage of B, the place where you want to go. The percentage ratios indicate how fast you 'catch up' with the data....SO COOL!!!!

We then had a lunch talk with [Caitlin Morris](http://www.caitlinmorris.net/). She just finished a residency at [Fabrica](http://www.fabrica.it/) in Italy. She focuses on technology as the means of an experience: technology that drives the experience rather than interfacing with technology directly.  She gave us a very summary of her work at Fabrica as well as her path to where she is now. She was just so sweet and relatable and made me feel like I could one day be doing something similar. 

After this, Jonas let a workshop on node.js and showed us a bunch of [cool modules](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs) to use with it. Node.js is a chrome javascript engine that is taken out of the browser and put on the command line. It seems like a pretty powerful tool that may be able to replace python for me while helping me get more familiar with the web development.

I worked on circuits homework after this, and with a little bit of help from Taeyoon, I was able to create a buffer, not, and, or, nand, nor gates! I'm pretty sure I understand everything that's going on as well! Unfortunately, there was one casualty in the process: goodbye mr. transistor...

We ended the night with an SFPC family pizza dinner!
