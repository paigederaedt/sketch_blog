Today was another studio day, and a very productive one! I worked on writing/consolidating a lot of blog posts. This blog is finally in a presentable state! Now I can just worry about customizing and writing one post a day! I spent a good part of the day documenting all of my ideas on a [personal hackpad](https://sfpc.hackpad.com/Paiges-Thoughts-at-SFPC-iwo24nJ6eTv). It felt really good to get all of my thoughts consolidated in one place where I can get some feedback.

After lunch, Sarah led a terminal workshop which was pretty helpful. I definitely learned a few small tricks that I didn't know before!

I spent the rest of the day working with Puzzlescript! [Here](http://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=0a701006213ee1a496a8) is my creation!
