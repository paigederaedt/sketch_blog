We spent the morning learning more animation from Zach. He showed us a bunch of examples using trigonometry to create cyclic animation patterns that really bring objects to life. He asked us to create an animation inspired by John Whitney and also make a creature that we animate with certain characteristics as homework.

After this was Ramsey's class. We spent some time going over some examples of projects that other students made from his homework using Post Script. Lauren managed to create nyan cat with it - pretty impressive!

Later at night, we went to CUNY to meet with another 'alternative' school based in Paris called [IHEAP](http://iheap.fr/) for a discussion about ['Education on the Periphery'](http://centerforthehumanities.org/program/education-periphery-iheap-and-school-poetic-computation-conversation#sthash.81yaj8fu.dpuf%C2%A0) facilitated by Michael Mandiberg. Each school discussed their program and had students introduce themselves and talk a little about what they're working on. They're all doing cool stuff and they're also planning on opening up another IHEAP in New York. After, we all went out for Korean BBQ.
